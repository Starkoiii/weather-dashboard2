# weather-dashboard
I created a weather dashboard site to combat not knowing what the weather is going to be like before you visit a location, its features involve the temperature, wind, humidity and a 5 day forecast for the future days to come.

## Accesibility/Grading requirements

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

## Usage

A page that allows for visitors to check the weather of a city before they visit
